Common Problem-solving Strategies: (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)

- Brute Force: the simplest and easiest way, when you do no have any idea, start with
Brute Force, then think how to optimize it
- Recursion: solve a problem by solving sub-problems
- Divide & Conquer: solve a big problem by solving small problems and combine the
results of small problems
- Data Structure: proper data structure would be very helpful when solve some specific
problems

================================================================================
Common Optimization Strategies:

- Run Time & Space complexity analysis, see what is the complexity of current solution
and how we are going to optimize it. (O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(n * logn) < O(n ^ 2) < O(n ^ m))
- O(1) - Array, HashMap, HashSet access
- O(logn) - path length of a tree
- O(n) - Array traverse
- O(n * logn) - Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- O(n ^ 2) - Enumeration, double loops
- O(n ^ m) - Enumeration, multip layers of loops
- Space & Time trade-off: sometimes we can use more space to fasten the solution
(HashTable to remember result to avoid computing same values twice, DP)
- Pruning: skip unnecessary steps to improve the time performance
- Sorting: solve some digit comparasion related problem would be easier if everythinkg
is already sorted
- Data Structure: proper data structure would be very helpful when solve some specific
problems

Common Optimization Strategies using Data Structure: (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)

- Quick Lookup: HashTable, HashMap, HashSet
- Search & Indexing: Tree, Balanced Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Priority & Sequence: Queue, Priority Queue (Heap), Stack
- String Search: Trie
- Numeric Value Search: BST (Binary Search Tree)
- Grouping & Classification: Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
- Range: Segment Tree
- Range Sum: Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-indexed-tree-or-fenwick-tree-2/)
- Self-Balanced Tree: Red-black Tree, AVL Tree
