Problem Classification:

- Search
-- DFS

-- Recursion

- Data Structure
-- Stack
-- HashMap
-- HashSet
-- Heap
-- Graph
-- Queue
-- LinkedList
-- Tree
-- Union-Find (Disjoint Set) (Grouping Problem) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)
-- Binary Indexed Tree (Array Range Pre-sum) (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-indexed-tree-or-fenwick-tree-2/)
-- Segment Tree (Interval) (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-sum-of-given-range/)

- Sort
-- Bucket Sort
-- Quick Sort
-- Merge Sort (Divide & Conquer)

- Divide & Conquer
-- Merge Sort

- Bit Manipulation

- Math

================================================================================
Common Strategies:

- Divide & Conquer: solve a big problem by solving small problems (Binary Search)
- Recursion: solve a problem by solving sub-problems
- Sorting: solve some digit comparasion related problem would be easier if everythinkg
is already sorted
- Space & Time trade-off: sometimes we can use more space to fasten the solution
(HashTable to remember result to avoid computing same values twice, Array)
- Data Structure: proper data structure would be very helpful when solve some specific
problems (HashTable for quick lookup, Tree/Balanced Tree is good for indexing, Queue
and Stack good for dealing with sequence)
